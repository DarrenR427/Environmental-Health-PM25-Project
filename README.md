# PM2.5 Air Quality Dashboard – Randolph County, Missouri

This project analyzes daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations from an EPA monitoring site located in **Randolph County, Missouri** (approx. 39.4492°N, –92.4266°W). The goal is to evaluate trends, seasonal variation, and overall air-quality conditions using environmental health analytics and Tableau visualization techniques.

## Project Overview

This dashboard provides a public-health–focused assessment of PM2.5 conditions using a **single-site EPA AQS dataset**. The analysis includes:

- **Daily trend visualization** showing pollutant variability  
- **Box-and-whisker plot** illustrating distribution and seasonal patterns  
- **KPI indicators**, including  
  - Average PM2.5 concentration  
  - Maximum recorded value  
  - Percent of days exceeding the EPA 12 µg/m³ standard  
- **Environmental health insights** explaining exposure risks and interpretation  
- **Fully interactive Tableau dashboard** (TWBX file)

---

## Key Findings

- PM2.5 levels at this Missouri monitoring site remain **mostly below the EPA’s 24-hour limit of 12 µg/m³**, indicating generally good air quality.
- Most readings fall between **4–10 µg/m³**, with occasional short-term spikes.
- Seasonal variation is visible in the distribution plot, suggesting influences such as weather patterns, agricultural activity, or regional pollutant transport.
- Fewer than expected days exceed EPA guidelines, reflecting **low exposure risk** for the local community.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau Public**  
- **EPA Air Quality System (AQS)** PM2.5 dataset  
- **Data visualization & environmental analytics**  
- **Geospatial coordinates for Missouri monitoring site**
